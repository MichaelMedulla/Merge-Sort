This program sorts an array using merge sort.
The user will be prompted to choose either to randomly create the array or have it read from a file.
The user will type "1" for random generation and "2" for it to be read from a file.
If "1" is selected, a random array will be generated with a length of 10 and each integer will be from 0-99.
The program then uses merge sort to sort the array, display it to the standard output, and print to a file named "array.txt".
If "2" is selected, the program will ask for the file name from the user.
For example "fileName.txt".
It will then read and sort the file inside the array using merge sort and print to standard input and to a new file named "array2.txt".
